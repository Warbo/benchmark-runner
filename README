# ASV Benchmark Runner #

The Nix derivation in `runner.nix` allows a Git repository to be benchmarked
using Airspeed Velocity (ASV). This is useful for continuous integration, since
normally we will only get a single Git revision (to aid reproducibility, Nix
deletes the `.git` directory by default), whilst ASV wants access to all of the
commits in order to benchmark them.

## Usage ##

The URL (remote or local) of the desired Git repository should be given either
as a `REPO` environment variable, or as a `<repo>` parameter (set via the
`NIX_PATH` environment variable, or via Hydra build inputs).
